<p>Getting started will hopefully be a breeze.  You will need to know and understand PHP and as much as us about web servers.  Thankfully we're n00bs on the web server side of things.  That being said we know there are a lot of things we don't know, so if you notice us doing something odd, goofy or just plain wrong, let us know!</p>
<p>If you find this documentation helpful, please hit us up and let us know what helped.  If we have gaps or hand-wave over things, let us know that as well.  It's not a helpful framework if you spend as much time writing your own framework as you would learning this one.</p>
