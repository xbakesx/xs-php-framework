<h2>These are pending features to be implemented, more-or-less prioritized.  If you need the framework to do something it does not currently do let us know!</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Models - The controllers need a way to access and use models that connect to a generic persistent state (session, database, flat files...?).</li>
    <li>Compress/Combine CSS - the framework is being informed in a programatic way about it's css files, we should compress them when not in debug mode</li>
    <li>Minify/Compress/Combine JS - the framework is being informed in a programatic way about it's js files, we should compress them when not in debug mode</li>
</ol>
